Gui Design
The program is aesthetically pleasing as it uses similar colors as located in the actual game itself. It is very clear that you must first select a class and if you do not first select a class the program will tell you to. It is very predictable as to what you are going to get when you click on each button. The user is in complete control and should comprehend what is to be done in the program; if not, the program will direct them towards the correct path.
