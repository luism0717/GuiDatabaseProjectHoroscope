# GuiDatabaseProjectHoroscope

## JavaFX database
##### The program allows you to add people and store their horoscope and a scene will take you to a detailed view of the horoscope and allow you to change the image

## Gui Design
##### The program is aesthetically pleasing as it uses colors to asimilate a horoscope program. It is very clear that you must first select a class and if you do not first select a class the program will tell you to. It is very predictable as to what you are going to get when you click on each button.
