# GuiDatabaseProjectHoroscope

## JavaFX database
##### The program allows you to add people and store their horoscope and a scene will take you to a detailed view of the horoscope and allow you to change the image

## Gui Design
##### The program is aesthetically pleasing as it uses colors to asimilate a horoscope program. It is very clear that you must first select a class and if you do not first select a class the program will tell you to. It is very predictable as to what you are going to get when you click on each button.

## Adhered to GUI Design Principles
##### We have used many different technigues in the GUI design process. I have created a clear and concise interface to make it easy on the user to navigate. I have made it so the user can interact with the program in a comfortable way. My interface is very consistent with the changes in the scene.

##### Some things that I intend to incorporate in the future is more functionailiy for user inputs and a more appealing CSS incorperated in the interface. I would want to provide more error checking to give user feedback on inputs that are entered.
